# Pulumi project in Python to deploy NGINX webserver in containers using AWS ECS Fargate

## Prerequisites

* [Install Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/)
* [Configure Pulumi to Use AWS](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/cloud-providers/aws/setup/) (if your AWS CLI is configured, no further changes are required)

## Running the Example

1. Create a new stack, which is an isolated deployment target for this example:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi stack init dev
    ```

2. Set your desired AWS region:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi config set aws:region us-east-1 # any valid AWS region will work
    ```

3. Create a Python virtualenv, activate it, and install dependencies:

    This installs the dependent packages [needed](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/how-pulumi-works/) for our Pulumi program.

    ```bash
    $ python3 -m venv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Deploy everything with a single `pulumi up` command. This will show you a preview of changes first, which
   includes all of the required AWS resources (clusters, services, and the like). Don't worry if it's more than
   you expected -- this is one of the benefits of Pulumi, it configures everything so that so you don't need to!

    ```bash
    $ pulumi up
    ```

    After being prompted and selecting "yes", your deployment will begin. It'll complete in a few minutes:

    ```bash
    Updating (dev):
         Type                             Name                Status
     +   pulumi:pulumi:Stack              aws-py-fargate-dev  created

    Outputs:
        url: "app-lb-ad43707-1433933240.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com"

    Resources:
        + 10 created

    Duration: 2m56s

    ```

   Notice that the automatically assigned load-balancer URL is printed as a stack output.

5. At this point, your app is running -- let's curl it. The CLI makes it easy to grab the URL:

    ```bash
    $ curl http://$(pulumi stack output url)
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
    <title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
    <style>
        body {
            width: 35em;
            margin: 0 auto;
            font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;
        }
    </style>
    </head>
    <body>
    <h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
    <p>If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and
    working. Further configuration is required.</p>

    <p><em>Thank you for using nginx.</em></p>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
   
7. Once you are done, you can destroy all of the resources, and the stack:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi destroy
    $ pulumi stack rm
    ```
